# 🎬 Movie Stack

A visually engaging and fully responsive movie discovery application built with **React 19 + TypeScript** and powered by the **OMDb API**.  
Users can effortlessly search for movies, TV series, or episodes, filter results by year or content type, and dive into detailed pages showing posters, ratings, genres, cast, and more.

Designed with a clean UI, smooth animations (via **Framer Motion**), and built using modern architecture (**Redux Toolkit**, **SCSS Modules**, **Vite**), this SPA delivers a fast and polished user experience — optimized for both desktop and mobile users.

Ideal for showcasing frontend development skills in real-world, API-integrated project scenarios.
